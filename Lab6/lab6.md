## What are the security implications of exposing or hiding data?
Exposing data, such as domain owner details or server information, can lead to targeted attacks, spam, and easier reconnaissance by attackers, but it also promotes transparency and trust, which is crucial for businesses and compliance. On the other hand, hiding data reduces the attack surface and protects privacy, but it can also be misused by malicious actors to conceal their identity and may lead to a lack of trust from users. Balancing exposure and privacy is key to maintaining security and credibility.
