### 1. What are the key lessons you learned about web application security, and how do they relate to the CIA Triad?  
Web application security emphasizes protecting data and systems in line with the CIA triad: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. Confidentiality ensures sensitive data is only accessible to authorized users, often enforced through encryption and access controls. Integrity focuses on preventing unauthorized modifications to data, achieved through input validation and cryptographic measures. Availability ensures systems remain accessible to legitimate users, safeguarded through DDoS protection and robust resource management. These principles form the foundation for designing and securing web applications effectively.

### 2. How do vulnerabilities and exploits affect web applications, and how can you defend against these attacks?
Vulnerabilities are weaknesses in an application’s code, configuration, or logic, while exploits are the methods attackers use to take advantage of those vulnerabilities. For example, an SQL injection attack leverages poorly sanitized inputs to manipulate database queries. Defending against such attacks requires proactive strategies like input validation, secure coding practices, patch management, and deploying Web Application Firewalls (WAFs). Regular security assessments and automated tools can help identify and address vulnerabilities before attackers exploit them.

### 3. What role do different layers (client, server, database, etc.) play in web security, and what specific threats exist at each layer?
Each layer of a web application contributes uniquely to security. The client layer is susceptible to threats like XSS and phishing, mitigated through secure input handling and Content Security Policies. The server layer faces risks like unauthorized access and insecure APIs, addressed through hardened configurations and access controls. The database layer is vulnerable to SQL injection and data breaches, requiring parameterized queries and encryption. The network layer, targeted by attacks like MITM and DDoS, benefits from HTTPS, firewalls, and DDoS protection measures. Coordinated defenses across all layers are crucial for comprehensive security.

### 4. Discuss how web application security can fail in terms of configuration, policy, or assumptions. Provide an example you’ve learned about.
Web application security often fails due to misconfigurations, weak policies, or incorrect assumptions. For instance, leaving a database exposed to the internet without a password is a common misconfiguration that leads to breaches. Weak password policies can enable attackers to compromise accounts easily. Additionally, assuming users will input only valid data can result in injection attacks. An example of such failure is the Equifax breach, where an unpatched vulnerability allowed attackers to exfiltrate sensitive data.

### 5. How do you think about risk and impact when evaluating web application security?
Assessing web application security involves understanding the risk, or likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited, and the impact it could have if exploited. High-risk vulnerabilities with severe potential consequences, such as unauthorized access to financial or personal data, are prioritized for remediation. A balanced approach helps allocate resources efficiently, addressing both low-risk but high-impact issues and high-risk vulnerabilities that are easy to exploit.

### 6. What prevention strategies have you found most effective.
Effective prevention starts with educating developers and administrators about secure practices and keeping software updated. Testing, such as penetration testing and code reviews, helps identify vulnerabilities early. Configuring systems securely, monitoring traffic for anomalies, and automating security scans strengthen defenses. Additionally, having a well-defined incident response plan ensures quick action in the event of a breach, reducing its impact. These strategies collectively create a robust security posture for web applications.
